#RTS Base
RTS Base is going to be a basic RTS system built in HaxeFlixel.

Project Goals:
*Be portable to other Haxe systems - This will mean that any system built with flixel will need to either be easily translated or avoided
*Must be simple to utilize
*Must leverage tiled map editor

The dev goals are as follows:
*Create Node system
*Use Click Activation to work with nodes
*Create Actors to occupy nodes
*Create Pathfinding for nodes
*Create Movement system for Actors
*Integrate tiled map editor
*Create simple Health/Attack system
*Create basic state machine
