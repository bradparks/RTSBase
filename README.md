#RTS Base
RTS Base is going to be a basic RTS system built in HaxeFlixel.

#Project Goals:
*Be portable to other Haxe systems - This will mean that any system built with flixel will need to either be easily translated or avoided
*Must be simple to utilize
*Must leverage tiled map editor

#The dev goals are as follows:
*Create Node system - Done
*Use Click Activation to work with nodes - Done
*Create Actors to occupy nodes - Done
*Create Pathfinding for nodes - Done
*Create Movement system for Actors - Done
*Integrate tiled map editor - Done 
*Create simple Health/Attack system - Done
*Create basic state machine - Done - though needs simplified to not take so long to start state actions
