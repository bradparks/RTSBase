#RTS Base
RTS Base is going to be a basic RTS system built in HaxeFlixel.


#Project Goals:
*Be portable to other Haxe systems - This will mean that any system built with flixel will need to either be easily translated or avoided
*Must be simple to utilize
*Must leverage tiled map editor

#Version .1 is finished! 
All the basics are in! Node based grid map built from tiled, with a* pathfinding, and Actors fighting utilizing statemachines! If you run it right now a demo level will play with some of my 8 bit art. All of which are free to use

#Version .2 Goals
Take in feedback from the community at large and contributors to projects that are going to utilize this system.
Adding buildings
Selecting and moving multiple units


.1 took a week of 1-2 hours a night, but I expect a month to get everything finished for v.2
